Happy Birthday to the most beautiful soul who lights up my world brighter than the sun! Every moment with you, feels like a dream come true, and today, everyone are celebrating how incredible person you are 💓. Your laughter is my favorite melody, your smile my greatest treasure, and your love is my constant inspiration. You are the magic in my life, and I’m endlessly grateful for every heartbeat we share. Even though miles separate us, my heart has never been closer to yours. You’re the first thought when I wake up and the last prayer before I sleep. Today, I wish I could hold you close, see your radiant smile, and feel the warmth of your hug, but know that my love is wrapping around you from afar. You’re my safe haven, my greatest strength, and the reason my world feels so full despite the distance. Every moment apart only reminds me how deeply I love you 🫀.
Here’s to you, my queen, the reason my heart flutters like butterflies every single day. I hope this birthday is as extraordinary and radiant as you are!!! 

Once again Happy Birthday Bangaram 🥳❤️💞!!!
